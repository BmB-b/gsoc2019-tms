 <h1> :rocket: Google Summer Of Code 2019 </h1>

<h2> Abstract </h2>
I propose the development of a web application that will support the whole lifecycle of a thesis creation, namely, a Thesis Management System(TMS) that will benefit the students as well as the professors. This proposed system aims at eliminating the time consuming procedures and paper work at the very basic level by encapsulating and automating them with in the web app. MoreoverTMS will provide the functionality of an open source digital repository of completed theses, where the student authors can share their work to a wide audience and may be cited more easily by companies and researchers in their academic community.
